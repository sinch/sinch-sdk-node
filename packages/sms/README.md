# Sinch SMS SDK for Node.js

This package contains the Sinch SMS SDK for Node.js for use with [Sinch APIs](https://developers.sinch.com/). To use it, you will need a Sinch account. Please [sign up](https://dashboard.sinch.com/signup) or [log in](https://dashboard.sinch.com/login) if you already have one.

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Warning:</span>
**This SDK is currently available for preview purposes only. It should not be used in production environments.**

## Installation

We recommend to use this SDK as part of the [`@sinch/sdk-core`](../../packages/sdk-core) package in order to make the most out of all the Sinch products.

However, it's still possible to use this SDK standalone is you need to access the SMS API only.

### With NPM

```bash
npm install @sinch/sms
```

### With Yarn

```bash
yarn add @sinch/sms
```

## Usage

### Credentials

The `SMS` API uses the Sinch unified authentication with OAuth2 **for the US and EU regions only**. You will need to provide the following credentials:
- projectId: can be found in the [Account Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys)
- keyId:: can be found in your Access key list in the [Account Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys)
- keySecret: can be found **ONLY** when generating a new access key: keep it safe!

If you want to use the other regions (BR, AU or CA) or if you prefer to use this type of credential for US or EU, you can use the API Token authentication. You will need to provide the following credentials:
- servicePlanId: can be found in the SMS dashboard, under [Services Apis](https://dashboard.sinch.com/sms/api/services)
- apiToken: can be found in the SMS dashboard, under [Services Apis](https://dashboard.sinch.com/sms/api/services)


### As part of the Sinch SDK

If you are using this SDK as part of the Sinch SDK (`@sinch/sdk-core`) you can access it as the `sms` property of the client that you would have instantiated.

```typescript
import { 
  SendSMSRequestData,
  SendSMSResponse,
  SinchClient,
  SinchSmsClient,
  ServicePlanIdCredentials,
  UnifiedCredentials,
  Region,
} from '@sinch/sdk-core';

const credentialsWithProjectId: UnifiedCredentials = {
  projectId: 'PROJECT_ID',
  keyId: 'KEY_ID',
  keySecret: 'KEY_SECRET',
  region: Region.UNITED_STATES, // Optional, default is 'us'. Only other possibility is 'eu'
};
const sinchWithProjectId = new SinchClient(credentialsWithProjectId);

const credentialsWithServicePlanId: ServicePlanIdCredentials = {
  servicePlanId: 'SERVICE_PLAN_ID',
  apiToken: 'API_TOKEN',
  region: Region.UNITED_STATES, // Optional, default is 'us'. Other possibilities are 'eu', 'br', 'au' and 'ca'
};
const sinchWithServicePlanId = new SinchClient(credentialsWithServicePlanId);

const requestData: SendSMSRequestData = {
  sendSMSRequestBody: {
    to: [
       '+12223334444',
       '+12223335555'
    ],
    from: '+12228889999',
    parameters: {
       name: {
          '+12223334444': 'John',
          default: 'there',
       }
    },
    body: 'Hi ${name}',
    type: 'mt_text', 
  },
};

// Access the 'sms' domain registered on the Sinch Client
// The request will be authenticated with OAuth2 and sent to https://zt.us.sms.api.sinch.com
const availabilityResult_1: SendSMSResponse 
    = await sinchWithProjectId.sms.batches.send(requestData);

// Access the 'sms' domain registered on the Sinch Client
// The request will be authenticated with the API Token and sent to https://us.sms.api.sinch.com
const availabilityResult_2: SendSMSResponse 
    = await sinchWithServicePlanId.sms.batches.send(requestData);
```

### Standalone

The SDK can be used standalone if you need to use only the SMS APIs. As for a usage with the Sinch Client, you can choose to use the `projectId` or `servicePlanId` credentials.

#### With the Oauth2TokenRequest plugin

```typescript
import {
  Region,
  ServicePlanIdCredentials,
  UnifiedCredentials,
 } from '@sinch/sdk-client';
import { 
  SendSMSRequestData,
  SendSMSResponse,
  Sms,
} from '@sinch/sms';

const credentialsWithProjectId: UnifiedCredentials = {
  projectId: 'PROJECT_ID',
  keyId: 'KEY_ID',
  keySecret: 'KEY_SECRET',
  region: Region.UNITED_STATES, // Optional, default is 'us'. Only other possibility is 'eu'
};
// Declare the 'sms' controller in a standalone way
const smsWithProjectId = new Sms(credentialsWithProjectId);

const credentialsWithServicePlanId: ServicePlanIdCredentials = {
  servicePlanId: 'SERVICE_PLAN_ID',
  apiToken: 'API_TOKEN',
  region: Region.UNITED_STATES, // Optional, default is 'us'. Other possibilities are 'eu', 'br', 'au' and 'ca'
};
// Declare the 'sms' controller in a standalone way
const smsWithServicePlanId = new Sms(credentialsWithServicePlanId);

const requestData: SendSMSRequestData = {
    // some request parameters
};

// Use the standalone declaration of the 'sms' controller
// The request will be authenticated with OAuth2 and sent to https://zt.us.sms.api.sinch.com
const response_1: SendSMSResponse = await smsWithProjectId.batches.send(requestData);

// Use the standalone declaration of the 'sms' controller
// The request will be authenticated with the API Token and sent to https://us.sms.api.sinch.com
const response_2: SendSMSResponse = await smsWithServicePlanId.batches.send(requestData);
```

## Promises

All the methods that interact with the Sinch APIs use Promises. You can use `await` in an `async` method to wait for the response, or you can resolve them yourself with `then()` / `catch()`.

```typescript
// Method 1: Wait for the Promise to complete (you need to be in an 'async' method)
let batchResponse: SendSMSResponse;
try {
  batchResponse = await sinch.sms.batches.send(requestData);
  console.log(`The SMS has been sent successfully: batch id = ${batchResponse.id}`);
} catch (error: any) {
  console.error(`ERROR ${error.statusCode}: the SMS could not be sent`);
}

// Method 2: Resolve the promise
sinch.sms.batches.send(requestData)
  .then(response => console.log(`The SMS has been sent successfully: batch id = ${response.id}`))
  .catch(error => console.error(`ERROR ${error.statusCode}: the SMS could not be sent`));
```

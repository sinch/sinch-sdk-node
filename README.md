Here you'll find documentation related to the Sinch Node.js SDK, including how to install it, initialize it, and start developing Node.js code using Sinch services.

To use Sinch services, you'll need a Sinch account and access keys. You can sign up for an account and create access keys at [dashboard.sinch.com](https://dashboard.sinch.com).

Once logged-in you'll find different sets of credentials to access to the various Sinch APIs:
 - On the [Account dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/account/access-keys), you will find your `projectId` and access keys composed of pairs of `keyId` / `keySecret`. Unless mentionned otherwise, these are the credentials you will need to access most of the Sinch APIs
  - For the **Verification** and **Voice** APIs, you will find pairs of `App key` / `App secret` in the [Verification dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/verification/apps) and the [Voice dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/voice/apps) respectively. Note that the apps are the same, wherever you access them.
  - For the **SMS** API, the standard credentials (`projectId`, `keyId`, `keySecret`) are available only in the US and EU regions. If your business involves any of the other regions (BR, CA, AU), you will need to use your `servicePlanId` that you can find on the [Service APIs dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/sms/api/services). Note that the `servicePlanId` supports all the regions (US, EU, BR, CA, AU).
  - The **Conversation** API uses the standard credentials (`projectId`, `keyId`, `keySecret`) and is available on the US, EU and BR regions.

For more information on the Sinch APIs on which this SDK is based, refer to the official [developer documentation portal](developers.sinch.com).

## Prerequisites

Before being able to execute the commands described below, you will need to install Node.js. We recommend to [install the current or the LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en).

NPM will come with the Node.js installation. If you want to use `yarn` as a package manager, you'll need to install it separately with the following command:
```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

> **Warning**:
> Do not use this Node.js library in front-end applications (Angular, React, Vue.js, ...). Doing so can expose your Sinch credentials to end-users as part of the HTML/JavaScript files loaded on their browser.

### Node.js supported versions

The Sinch Node.js SDK follows the [Node.js release cycle](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases). 

This means that Node.js version 18 will be supported until May 2025. However, we recommend you to use the current LTS (20.11.0) or the current Node.js version.

## Installation

### With NPM

```bash
# Create a new folder (For Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell users, replace 'mkdir' by 'md')
mkdir my-sinch-app
# Move to the new folder
cd my-sinch-app
# Init the project (provide information about your project, such as package name, version, description, ...)
npm init
# Install the Sinch Node.js SDK dependency
npm install @sinch/sdk-core
```

### With Yarn

```bash
# Create a new folder (For Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell users, replace 'mkdir' by 'md')
mkdir my-sinch-app
# Move to the new folder
cd my-sinch-app
# Init the project (provide information about your project, such as package name, version, description, ...)
yarn init
# Install the Sinch Node.js SDK dependency
yarn add @sinch/sdk-core
```

## SDK usage

### Constructor

To initialize communication with the Sinch servers, credentials obtained from the Sinch dashboard must be provided to the main client class of this SDK. It's highly recommended to not hardcode these credentials and to load them from environment variables instead.

```typescript
import {
  SinchClient,
} from '@sinch/sdk-core';

const sinchClient = new SinchClient(sinchClientParameters);
```
where `sinchClientParameters` is an object containing the properties required to access the API you want to use:
 - for **Verification** and **Voice** APIs:
   - `applicationKey`
   - `applicationSecret`
   - (For the Voice API, `voiceRegion` is optional. Default is empty).
 - for **SMS** API when using the AU, BR or CA region (works also for US and EU)
   - `servicePlanId`
   - `apiToken`
   - (`region` is optional. Default is `US`).
 - for all the other APIs (including SMS is using the US and EU regions only)
   - `projectId`
   - `keyId`
   - `keySecret`
   - (For the SMS API, `region` is optional. Default is `US`).

From this client, you have access to all the SDK services supporting the Sinch APIs:
```typescript
import {
  SinchClient,
} from '@sinch/sdk-core';

const sinch = new SinchClient(sinchClientParameters);
const conversationService = sinch.conversation;
const faxService = sinch.fax;
const numbersService = sinch.numbers;
const smsService = sinch.sms;
const verificationService = sinch.verification;
const voiceService = sinch.voice;
```

### Promises

All the methods that interact with the Sinch APIs use Promises.

```typescript
const response: SendSMSResponse = await smsService.batches.send({
   sendSMSRequestBody: {
      to: [
         '+12223334444',
         '+12223335555'
      ],
      from: '+12228889999',
      parameters: {
         name: {
            '+12223334444': 'John',
            default: 'there',
         }
      },
      body: 'Hi ${name}',
      type: 'mt_text',
   },
});
console.log(`The SMS has been sent successfully. Here is the batch id: ${response.id}`)
```
